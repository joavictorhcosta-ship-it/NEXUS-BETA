# NEXUS — Shareable Preview (No Build)
This is a zero-build React + Tailwind preview of your NEXUS app.

## How to share quickly
- **Vercel**: New Project → Import → drag & drop this folder → Framework: “Other”. That’s it.
- **Netlify**: Add new site → Deploy manually → drag & drop the folder.
- **GitHub Pages**: Create a repo → push these files → enable Pages → branch `main` / root.
- **CodeSandbox / StackBlitz**: Import this ZIP; it auto-hosts with a live URL.

No Node build is required. Everything runs from `index.html` using React + Babel + TailwindCDN.
